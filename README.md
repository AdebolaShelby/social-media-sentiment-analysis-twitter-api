1. Project Setup and Planning
    * Objective: Assess the sentiment of tweets regarding the 2024 presidential election over the last 6 months to determine:
        * Sentiment trends (positive, negative, neutral) related to the candidates, parties, and general election discourse.
        * Key issues/topics that people tweet about the most (e.g., healthcare, economy, immigration, social justice).
            * Topics and Keywords:
                * Focus on relevant election hashtags, candidate names, and key political topics (e.g., #Election2024, #Biden2024, #Trump2024, #Vote2024).
                * Include specific issue-based hashtags (e.g., #Healthcare, #Economy, #ClimateChange, #Border).
    * Tools: Tweepy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TextBlob, VADER, and other relevant NLP libraries installed.

2. Data Extraction
    * Connect to Twitter API: Use the Twitter API to pull tweets from the last 6 months related to the 2024 presidential election.
    Search Parameters:
    * Use Tweepy to search for relevant tweets based on election-related hashtags and keywords.
    * Filter by date (e.g., tweets within the last 6 months) and language (English).
    * Data Storage: Store the data in a CSV file or mongo database, capturing tweet content, date, username, and other relevant metadata (e.g., retweets, likes).
3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
    * Text Cleaning: As with any tweet dataset, clean the text by:
        * Removing URLs, mentions, and hashtags.
        * Lowercasing all text.
        * Removing emojis, special characters, and punctuation.
    * Tokenization and Stopword Removal: Tokenize the tweets into words, and remove stopwords.
    * Topic-Specific Cleaning: Remove irrelevant noise such as common words unrelated to the election (e.g., "thanks", "lol", etc.).
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    * Most Frequent Words/Issues: Identify the most commonly used words in the tweets to get a sense of the most-discussed issues.
        * Create a frequency plot or word cloud for these terms.
    * Hashtag Analysis: Identify the most frequently used hashtags to see which issues are trending the most (e.g., #Healthcare, #GunControl, #Inflation).
    * Time Analysis: Plot tweet activity over time to identify any spikes during major election-related events (e.g., debates, rallies).
5. Sentiment Analysis
    * Use sentiment analysis techniques to categorize the tweets.
    * Rule-Based Sentiment Analysis:
        * TextBlob: Calculate the sentiment polarity of each tweet (positive, negative, or neutral).
        * VADER Sentiment: Since VADER is designed for social media text, it will be useful for more nuanced sentiment detection, especially for handling informal language, abbreviations, and slang.
    * Sentiment Trends:
        * Analyze how the sentiment has shifted over the past 6 months.
        * Look for patterns around key political events (e.g., announcements, debates, policy launches).
        * Visualize sentiment trends over time using a line plot to highlight peaks and dips in public opinion.
6. Topic Modeling (Optional)
    * Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA): Apply LDA topic modeling to discover hidden themes in the tweets. This will to automatically uncover the most-discussed topics, like the economy, healthcare, and climate change, without needing predefined hashtags or keywords.
    * Issue Frequency: Determine which issues/topics (e.g., #Economy, #GunControl, #Immigration) dominate the election discourse and how sentiment aligns with these issues.
7. Visualization of Sentiment and Topics
    * Sentiment Over Time: Create a time series plot showing how sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) evolves over the 6-month period.
    Sentiment Distribution: Use bar charts or pie charts to show the overall distribution of sentiment.
    * Top Issues: Visualize the top 5-10 election issues based on tweet frequency, and overlay sentiment to see how people feel about these issues.
    * Heatmaps: Use a heatmap to show correlations between different issues and sentiments (e.g., negative sentiment toward the economy vs. positive sentiment on healthcare).
8. Conclusion and Insights
    * Key Findings: Summarize the key insights from the analysis above:
    * Which issues are people discussing the most?
    * Is sentiment overall more positive, negative, or neutral regarding the election?
    * How have sentiment trends changed over the last 6 months, and how do they correlate with major political events?
    * Election Issues: Highlight any key issues that seem to be driving voter sentiment (e.g., economic concerns, social justice, healthcare).
